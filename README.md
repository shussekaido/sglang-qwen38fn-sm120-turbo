Serving stack for **Qwen3.8-Flash-Next** on 96 GiB VRAM (1x RTX Pro 6000, might also work on DGX Spark):

Qwen3.8-Flash-Next is a highly performant LLM that serves as a preview for the future Qwen4 family.
Despite being undertrained, and having very few active parameters and a small size (125B + 6B active + 51B of offloadable embedding table), benchmarks show performance comparable to closed-source LLMs from just 3 months ago (e.g. Opus 4.8).

## Numbers

On the NVFP4 checkpoint [`RadixArk/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4`](https://huggingface.co/RadixArk/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4), served by the day-0 SGLang image:
- 1x RTX Pro 6000, power-limited to 360W, memory overclocked by +3000MT/s (+6000 in LACT)
- 939456 tokens in KV cache for 4 max concurrent requests
- 856256 tokens in KV cache for 8 max concurrent requests
- 11k~13k prefill tok/s

## Behind-the-scenes

This builds on top of the day-0 official Docker image `lmsysorg/sglang:qwen38flashnext`:

- **0001** makes fp8 KV cache work on sm_120.
- **0002** linear-attention layers don't cache MTP drafts, they are recomputed. Saves ~2 GB of KV budget. (And it's surprisingly not slower)
- **0003** quantizes at load whatever the checkpoint left in bf16 (attention, MLP, lm_head, hyperconnection mix) to MXFP8 to reduce memory bandwidth at close to zero-accuracy cost. On FlashInfer 0.6.18, this should be even faster as FlashInfer 0.6.18 integrates [`local-inference-lab/b12x`](https://github.com/local-inference-lab/b12x) and its hardware-accelerated block-scaled GEMM kernel.
- **0004** prepares support for https://huggingface.co/local-inference-lab/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4 which has a calibration dataset richer than CNN/DailyMail. This is important to get proper scales for NVFP4 activations so signal isn't lost due to oversaturation because the calibration scale doesn't represent actual maximum.
- **0005** keeps abandoned runs from eating the machine: an aborted or timed-out client now really evicts its request, and no longer starves the queue behind it.

## Build and serve

Modify the top of `serve_sglang_qwen3.8-flash-next-example.sh` for your machine:
- `IMAGE`: tag you built below
- `CHECKPOINT`: `radixark` (validated) or `lil` (WIP)
- `MODEL_SOURCE`: `hf` (downloads to `HF_CACHE`) or `local` (reads `LOCAL_MODELS/<dir>` offline)
- `GPU_UTIL`, `MAX_RUNNING`, `HICACHE_SIZE`: KV fraction, concurrency, KVcache RAM offloading
- `PODNAME`, `SGLANG_PORT`: container name and port

```bash
podman build -t localhost/sglang-qwen38fn-sm120-turbo:r21 .
./serve_sglang_qwen3.8-flash-next-example.sh    # recap of the full config goes to stderr
curl -s localhost:30000/health
```

Keep your own variants in `internal/`: the folder ships empty and everything in it is git-ignored, so a customized launcher (`internal/serve_my.sh`, host paths, bench settings) lives beside the stack without ever being committed or published.

## Acknowledgements

While I choose different solutions, a significant amount of work has gone into both quant and tuning inference engines.
